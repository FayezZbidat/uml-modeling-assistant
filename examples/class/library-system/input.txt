A library issues loan items to customers. Each customer is known as a
member and is issued a membership card that shows a unique member
number. Along with the membership number, other details on a customer
must be kept such as a name, address, and date of birth. The library is
made up of a number of subject sections. Each section is denoted by a
classification mark. A loan item is uniquely identified by a bar code. There
are two types of loan items, language tapes, and books. A language tape has
a title language (e.g. French), and level (e.g. beginner). A book has a title,
and author(s). A customer may borrow up to a maximum of 8 items. An
item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend a current loan. When
an item is issued the customerâ€™s membership number is scanned via a bar
code reader or entered manually. If the membership is still valid and the
number of items on loan less than 8, the book bar code is read, either via
the bar code reader or entered manually. If the item can be issued (e.g. not
reserved) the item is stamped and then issued. The library must support
the facility for an item to be searched and for a daily update of records.
